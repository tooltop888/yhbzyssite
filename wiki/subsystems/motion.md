# Motion system

Motion is CSS first, JavaScript last. The full doctrine is
docs/conventions/motion.md; this page maps the moving parts.

## The catalog (src/styles/motion/)

Six families imported by motion/index.css:22-27: fades, slides, zooms,
attention, materials, scroll. Together they declare 55 `animate-*` utilities
via Tailwind 4 `@utility`, each embedding its own keyframes. tokens.css adds
the three brand animations rise, marquee and pulse-slow (tokens.css:145-147,
keyframes :277-305). Conventions, written at motion/index.css:6-19:

- entries and exits play once with fill both, so cascades are inline
  animation-delay on children and nothing flashes its final state early;
- loops are slow and low amplitude;
- tuning happens at the element ([animation-duration:1.2s], the
  --motion-travel / --motion-scale / --motion-float / --motion-parallax
  knobs), never by editing the catalog;
- three shared easings at motion/index.css:31-34, the expo-out being the
  same curve as animate-rise.

The scroll family (motion/scroll.css) drives animations with
`animation-timeline: view()`: progression follows the element through the
viewport, no observer, no script.

## The reveal wrappers

Reveal (src/components/ui/reveal/Reveal.astro) and StaggerReveal
(src/components/ui/stagger-reveal/StaggerReveal.astro) trigger animate-rise
on viewport entry, one shared IntersectionObserver per wrapper type.

Their non-negotiable guarantee: content is only hidden by the script, right
before observation (Reveal.astro:26-32, StaggerReveal.astro:29-35). With
JavaScript off or reduced motion on, nothing was ever hidden and the page
renders complete. Both re-init on astro:page-load with a data-*-ready guard
(Reveal.astro:48-69), which makes them view-transition safe. StaggerReveal
observes the root and fans out incremental delays to its direct children
(StaggerReveal.astro:42-52; step prop, 90ms default).

## Reduced motion: three layers, three reasons

1. Global kill switch: src/styles/global.css:307-316 collapses every CSS
   animation, transition and smooth scroll under prefers-reduced-motion.
   Written once so no component depends on discipline.
2. Local guard in motion/scroll.css:17-26: a view() timeline ignores
   animation-duration, so the global collapse cannot neutralize it. Each
   scroll utility therefore nests @media (prefers-reduced-motion:
   no-preference) and @supports (animation-timeline: view()); without
   support, elements are simply visible.
3. JavaScript-driven motion: the CSS guard cannot see it. The reveal scripts
   check matchMedia before hiding anything (Reveal.astro:49-52), and the
   shrinking navbar disables its own transitions in a local media query.

## No heavy effect

There is no canvas and no WebGL, and nothing loops on its own. The heaviest
thing that moves is an entrance reveal, which plays once and stops. There are no
blurred halos drifting behind a title, anywhere in the family.
