<!-- docs/design.md - the Aloha Pixel design doctrine: what this house will and will not ship, and why. -->

# The Aloha Pixel design doctrine

This is the house standard for every theme Aloha Pixel builds. It is not a style
guide in the usual sense - it does not tell you which blue to use. It tells you
which decisions have already been made, which shapes are refused, and what has
to be true before a page ships.

Read it before you add a section, and again before you add an effect. The family
is seven themes - Aloha, Reef, Kai, Koa, Swell, Nalu and Kona. Two of them are
headless: Nalu reads its catalogue from a WooCommerce shop and Kona from a
Shopify one, instead of from files, which changes where the data lives and
nothing about the rules below.

## Why this file exists

Generated interfaces have a look. Not a bad look exactly, but a recognisable
one, and once a reader recognises it they stop reading the page and start
reading the tool that made it. That is the failure this file exists to prevent.

The tells are not mysterious. They are a small set of shapes that appear when
nobody made a decision: a purple gradient behind centred text, three equal
cards in a row, a headline filled with a gradient, one font doing every job, a
pill badge announcing a version nobody asked about, a row of round numbers.
Each one is what you get when a layout is assembled instead of designed.

So the doctrine is mostly a list of refusals, and for each refusal, the thing we
do instead. A refusal without a replacement is a gap, and gaps fill with defaults.

Where the house does not obey its own rule, this file says so by name. A
doctrine describing an imaginary house is worth less than none: the first
person to run `grep` finds the gap, and then nothing else here is believed.

## The one test

Before anything ships, one question: **would a reader be able to name the
studio that made this from the page alone?**

If the answer is no, the page is not finished. Not wrong - unfinished. It means
nothing on it is ours yet, and everything below is in service of that question.

---

## 1. Type

**The pairing is the design.** Every theme has exactly two families: a display
face that carries the character, and a body face for everything a reader
actually reads. The display face is what makes each theme itself.

| Theme | Display | Body |
|---|---|---|
| Reef | Space Grotesk | Instrument Sans |

Two families. Never three, never one: a page set entirely in its body face is a
document, and a page with four families is a ransom note.

**What is refused.** Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Poppins, Montserrat, Lato,
Nunito, and `system-ui` as a display face, when they arrive as a default. Not
because they are bad faces - Inter is an excellent face - but because they are
the ones every tool reaches for first, and a reader who has seen forty
generated pages this month has seen all forty in Inter.

**Aloha is the exception in the family, and it is named rather than
hidden.** It carries Inter Tight and Roboto, two of the faces this section
refuses, set at weight 800 with negative tracking, which is a place no default
puts them, and it was built before this file was written. That is an
explanation, not an exemption: the rule stands, and Aloha's next major version
is where it gets settled.

**The accent word.** Every big title carries exactly one word in the accent
role. That word keeps the display face and its weight. It does not become an
italic serif.

The italic-serif accent word is the most common ornament on the web right now,
it appears in every generated landing page, and it says nothing. Ours says
something with less: the accent word only changes colour, so the title keeps
one voice and the eye still lands on the word that matters.

One accent word per title; two is a decoration. The rule lives in
`.accent-script` in `src/styles/global.css`: same font as the title, primary
colour, no underline: no decorative stroke under a title, anywhere in the house.

**Scale.** Five display steps, tuned with `clamp()` so they hold from 320 px to
1440 px. Line height tightens as size grows: 1.6 for prose, under 1.1 for the
largest display. Negative letter-spacing on the big steps only, since a
tracked-out body face reads as a slide.

**Measure.** Prose lives between 45 and 75 characters, and `.measure-prose` and
`.measure-wide` exist so nobody guesses: a full-width paragraph on a 1440 px
screen is unreadable however good the face is.

---

## 2. Colour

**One anchor hue per theme, one accent, and neutrals tinted toward the anchor.**

The anchor is what `--color-primary` resolves to. These are the literal values
it resolves to in light mode, read from `src/styles/tokens.css`, not the
palette shade the ramp is named after:

| Theme | Anchor | Accent |
|---|---|---|
| Reef | reef turquoise `#147ea0` | coral `#e6411c` |

Each anchor is the 600 shade of its ramp rather than the 500 the palette is
built around, for one reason: button labels are white, and 500 falls under a
4.5 contrast ratio. In dark mode the anchor climbs one step lighter, to 400,
and to 300 in Koa. The anchor is the action colour: buttons, links and focus
rings are made of it, and it is what a reader learns to read as "this responds".

Coral is the second voice, mapped to `--color-accent`, and its ramp is identical
to the hex in every theme. It is the only warm note in an otherwise cold
house, and it is rationed: an eyebrow, a marker.
It never dominates a page, because an accent that dominates is a second
background. Reef alone takes coral a step darker in light mode, its ground being
paler than the other four.

**What is refused.**

- Background gradients used INSTEAD of a photograph on a hero. Especially
  purple to blue, and especially behind centred text. If a hero needs depth it
  gets a photograph. A tinted ground under a photograph is a different thing
  and is allowed; a mesh where the picture should be is not.
- Gradient-filled headlines (`background-clip: text`). Solid ink, always: a
  headline needing a gradient to be interesting has the wrong words in it.
- Pure `#000`, anywhere, as a colour. Every dark ground in the family is the
  darkest shade of its own anchor, `#0a0f17` here.
  None of them is black.
- The thick coloured stripe down one edge of a card.

**Where pure white is allowed, and it is exactly three places.** A hex is not a
colour when it is an alpha channel: `color-mix(in oklab, #ffffff 14%,
transparent)` and a mask written `#000` are opacity, and they pass. Beyond
that, `#ffffff` survives as the fill of a light card and as the text on a
primary or accent fill where contrast demands it. Both are unanimous.

The light page ground is tinted, in all six, and the argument that settled it
is not taste: a card is filled `#ffffff`, so on a white ground the card and the
paper are the same colour and a one-pixel rule is the only thing saying which
is on top. A card that does not lift is a framed paragraph. The tint is the 50
of each theme's own neutral and the section band drops to the 100, so the
two-beat rhythm is unchanged.

**Light is the default.** Every site in the house opens light and offers dark. Dark-first
was the earlier house position and it was wrong: a theme is judged in the two
seconds before anyone touches a toggle, and dark-by-default made every theme in
the family look like the same dark theme. Both modes are composed, neither is
an inversion: in dark mode shadows become luminous borders and inner glows,
because a drop shadow on a dark surface is invisible and the depth has to come
from somewhere.

**The token contract.** Three floors: the raw palette, semantic aliases, and
the utilities that markup is allowed to touch. Markup writes `bg-background`,
`text-foreground`, `border-border`. It never writes `bg-ink-900`. This is not
tidiness - `pnpm rebrand` repaints a whole theme by editing the first floor
only, and one leaked palette class in a component breaks that promise for
whoever installs it. `docs/conventions/tailwind.md` holds the full contract and
the grep that enforces it.

## 3. Layout

**Asymmetry by default.** A page that centres everything has made one decision and
repeated it. Text sits left, sections lead from the left, and the eye gets a
single starting line to come back to on every scroll.

Centre something when centring is the point, and it reads as deliberate.

**What is refused.**

- Three equal cards in a row. This is the most reliable tell there is. Two
  columns of unequal weight, a zigzag, an asymmetric bento, a plain list with
  rules between the items - all of these say more and cost less.
- Cards inside cards. One containment layer. If a bordered box contains
  bordered boxes, remove the outer one.
- The full-viewport centred hero with one sentence and one button. A hero
  fills the first screen, frame included: `min-h-[calc(100svh-1rem)]`, then
  `sm:calc(100svh-1.5rem)` and `md:calc(100svh-2rem)`, one value per step
  because the frame around the panel is `p-2 / p-3 / p-4`. Never a bare
  `80svh`, which leaves a pale band under the panel on arrival, and never a
  fixed pixel value. Padding does NOT change that height: `box-sizing` is
  `border-box`, so padding pushes the content down inside a box that does not
  move. What fills the screen is what matters, and it carries enough to decide
  with.
- Uniform radii everywhere. Containers are soft, the things inside them tight.
  When every corner has the same radius the page looks extruded.
- Pill badges announcing a version or a status above a title. The version
  number belongs in the changelog. Nobody picks a theme because it reached
  1.0.2.
- Rows of large round numbers. If a figure is real and decides something, put it
  where the decision is made, in a sentence, and let it be odd. Round numbers in
  a grid read as invented whether or not they are.
- Fixed pixel container widths. `container-page` is the reference.

**Cards are not the only container.** A border plus a shadow plus a white fill is
one option among several: a tinted ground with no border, spacing alone, a single
hairline rule. Varying containment is most of what makes a page look composed.

## 4. Photography

**Photographs, never gradients - and the licence is part of the design.**
Every hero and every cover in this family is a photograph. They come from
Pexels, chosen one by one and listed in `PHOTOS.md` with the page each one came
from.

What decides an image is its licence, not where it came from. Most subscription
stock libraries forbid redistributing their assets inside a template that is
itself resold; an image like that in a theme is a liability with a border radius,
however good it looks. The Pexels licence allows commercial use, modification and
redistribution inside a product like this one, and forbids only reselling an
unaltered photo as stock, which is not what a theme does.

So the rule is not "our own photographs". The rule is: **a photograph whose
licence anyone can verify, named in `THIRD-PARTY.md` and traceable in
`PHOTOS.md`.** A studio archive satisfies it too. Nothing else does.

**Every hero carries one, and nothing floats on top of it.** A gradient with
two blurred halos and nothing behind it is what a hero looks like when there
was no photograph available. There is always one. Aloha ran both for a while,
and the comment in its own hero said the halos dirtied the image while keeping
them anyway. The halos have left the family entirely, heroes and annexes
alike: a blurred disc drifting behind a title is the single most
recognisable mark of a page assembled by a machine, and the warm one passed
BEHIND the title, staining the photograph at the exact place the text has to
stay readable. All seven carry the photograph alone.

**How they are wired.** Images are not versioned as binaries. Each theme has a
build script holding a manifest of URLs, and `pnpm build` fetches them into
`src/assets` before Astro compiles. Every entry carries its own minimum width
and the script reads the WebP header to enforce it: 1920 px for a full-bleed
hero, 1200 px for a card, 1800 px for the one full-width band between the two.
A blurry image fails the build instead of reaching a reader, repositories stay
light, and the whole image set is swapped by editing a list of URLs.

**The veil.** Text over a photograph needs a scrim, and the scrim has to hold on
the brightest frame of the image, not the average one. Ours is a horizontal
gradient: dense where the text sits, opening toward the far edge so the photograph
is still a photograph. Two numbers matter - it starts around 90 % and it must not
reach 0 % before the text column ends.

One trap, and it has bitten this codebase twice. Inside a dark scene the scrim
must read the theme's own background variable, never `var(--color-background)`:
the semantic alias is substituted on `:root`, computes to the *light* value,
and that computed value inherits down into the dark subtree, so the scrim
paints white over the photograph. If a dark section is missing `.on-dark` or
`.dark`, force the value on the section itself rather than reaching for a
palette name in the markup.

## 5. Motion

**Motion is a ladder and you take the lowest rung that works.**

1. The CSS catalogue - `animate-*` utilities declared with `@utility` in
   `src/styles/motion/`, each carrying its own keyframes.
2. Viewport reveals - one shared IntersectionObserver, `Reveal` and
   `StaggerReveal`.
3. Scroll-driven CSS - `animation-timeline: view()`, no JavaScript.

**Six of the seven themes stop there and ship no animation library at all.**
Reef, Kai, Koa, Swell, Nalu and Kona depend on Astro, Tailwind, two fonts and
nothing else that moves; every effect in them is CSS or a `requestAnimationFrame`
loop written by hand.

Aloha is the exception, it is deliberate, and it is declared in its
`THIRD-PARTY.md`: `motion` drives springs and gestures inside its three React
islands, and `three` renders the optional WebGL ocean. Neither is a shortcut
past the ladder. `three` is never imported statically - it arrives through
`await import("three")` inside an IntersectionObserver, so a reader who never
reaches the hero never downloads it, and it does not initialise at all under
reduced motion. That is what the exception costs, and what it is required to
pay to exist.

**Reduced motion is enforced three times**, and the repetition is not redundancy.
Globally in `global.css`, because it collapses every transition. Again in
`scroll.css`, because a `view()` timeline ignores `animation-duration` and the
global collapse cannot reach it. And a third time in JavaScript, because a CSS
rule cannot un-hide what a script already hid.

**Nothing is hidden without JavaScript.** Reveal wrappers hide their content from
inside their own script, immediately before observing it: with JavaScript off,
nothing was ever hidden. Any `opacity: 0` sitting in markup or in an unguarded
CSS rule is a bug waiting for a slow connection.

**A heavy effect pays a toll.** Two exist here: the scroll-driven film
sequence, where the reader's scroll moves a video playhead, in every theme; and
Aloha's WebGL ocean. Both clear five conditions before they land:

- never initialise under reduced motion, under Save-Data, or on a 2g-class
  connection;
- load nothing until a real scroll gesture, proximity to the viewport, and an
  idle browser all hold at once;
- pause off-viewport and in hidden tabs;
- re-install on `astro:page-load` behind a `data-*-ready` guard and tear down
  on `astro:before-swap`, through a single AbortController;
- degrade to a still frame that carries the whole message on its own.

Any future effect clears the same five before it lands. Most will not, which is
the point.

**Interactive states are not optional.** Hover, `active:scale-[0.97]`, and a
visible `focus-visible` ring on everything that responds: a page with no pressed
state feels like a picture of an interface.

---

## 6. Copy

Words are design. A beautiful page with assembled copy fails the one test as
surely as a purple gradient does.

**Banned outright:** elevate, seamless, unleash, unlock, empower, next-gen,
game-changing, effortless, revolutionary, "take your X to the next level", and
any sentence that would survive being moved to a different company's website.

**Write the concrete thing instead.** Not "streamline your workflow" but "eight
products, and that is the whole shop". Not "trusted by industry leaders" but the
number of projects taken in a year, and why. Specificity is the cheapest
differentiator available and almost nobody spends it.

**Numbers are real or absent.** Counters here count something countable - pages
built, primitives, icons drawn - are never rounded up, and never gain a fifth
entry because four looked sparse.

**Demo content is labelled as demo content.** Lagoon in Aloha, Reef Notes in
Reef, Mascaret in Kai, Vela in Koa, Onda in Swell, Mareta in Nalu: six
inventions, whose authors and testimonials are inventions too, said so in each
LICENSE, each README, and the header of `src/config/siteData.json.ts`. A
fictional testimonial presented as real is not a design decision, it is a lie
with a border radius.

## 7. The review

Before a page ships, walk it once looking only for these. Finding one is a
problem. Finding two in the same viewport means the page was assembled, not
designed.

- [ ] A gradient standing in for a hero photograph, or filling a headline
- [ ] Three equal cards in a row
- [ ] A card inside a card
- [ ] One font doing display and body
- [ ] An italic serif accent word
- [ ] A pill badge above a title
- [ ] A row of round numbers
- [ ] Everything centred
- [ ] `#000` used as a colour, or `#ffffff` outside the three places above
- [ ] A hero with no photograph
- [ ] A decorative element that cannot be clicked, read, or explained
- [ ] Copy that would survive a find-and-replace of the company name
- [ ] A palette class in markup
- [ ] Any interactive element with no focus ring
- [ ] Any claim on the page that the repository cannot prove

That last one has cost this house more than every visual tell combined. A
feature list is checked in thirty seconds. If the page says the theme ships a
library, the library is in `package.json`, or the sentence goes. This file was
itself rewritten on that rule: it once claimed no theme here ships an animation
library, while `motion` and `three` sat in Aloha's dependencies, and it listed
four themes in tables that should have held five.

**What the house currently owes itself**, kept here so it stays visible: Aloha
carries two of the faces this file refuses, and that one waits for its next
major version, because changing the face of the flagship is not a patch.

---

## Where this comes from

The refusals above were sharpened by reading work published by others on the same
problem: the named-tell catalogues in Nutlope's Hallmark, the taste and redesign
skills published at tasteskill.dev by Leonxlnx, VoltAgent's collection of design
documents from studios whose work holds up, and Apple's Human Interface
Guidelines as distilled by dickwu's apple-design-skill.

Nothing here is copied from any of them. What is written above is this studio's
own position, argued from its own files, and every rule points at a real
decision in a real theme. They are named because reading them made this file
better, and because a house that refuses assembled work should not pretend it
arrived at everything alone.

The disagreements are ours too. This house keeps a single accent word in a big
title where some of that work would remove it, because that word is the
mark. It keeps light as the default where much of the field has settled on
dark. And it ships two heavy effects where a stricter reading would ship none.
