# SEO rules

## One file owns the head

src/layouts/BaseHead.astro writes every meta, canonical, OG, twitter,
favicon and feed tag by hand. No SEO package enters this repo; if a tag is
missing, add it there, readable and diffable. BaseLayout passes its
`title/description/image/type/noindex/introuvable` props straight through
(src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro:31).

- Title: `"Title | Brand"` unless the title already carries the brand, which
  the home page does on purpose (BaseHead.astro:41,
  src/pages/[...locale]/index.astro:61).
- Every page sets a written-for-humans `description`; the site-wide fallback
  (siteData.description) is for utility pages only.
- Canonical: one URL shape, derived from `trailingSlash: "always"`
  (astro.config.mjs:40) and computed in BaseHead.astro:45-48. File routes
  (rss.xml, robots.txt) keep their extension.
- The single source of the production origin is `site` in
  astro.config.mjs:36. It feeds canonical, OG, sitemap, robots.txt and
  llms.txt at once; never hardcode the domain elsewhere.

## JSON-LD: constructors only

Structured data is built exclusively with the typed constructors in
src/js/schema.ts (`organization` :30, `website` :48, `article` :72,
`faqPage` :105, `breadcrumbList` :126, `softwareApplication` :154) and
injected through the head slot:

```astro
<Fragment slot="head">
  {schemas.map((node) => (
    <script is:inline type="application/ld+json" set:html={JSON.stringify(node)} />
  ))}
</Fragment>
```

as done in src/pages/[...locale]/index.astro:66-73. Never hand-write a
JSON-LD object in a page: the constructors compact away undefined keys,
normalize dates to ISO 8601, and keep nested nodes free of `@context`. Their
behavior is pinned by src/js/schema.selfcheck.ts
(run: `node src/js/schema.selfcheck.ts`).

Placement map:

- Home: organization + website (index.astro). Organization appears once on the
  site, here. A blog home is not a sales page; it declares nothing it does not
  show.
- Blog post: article + breadcrumbList (blog/[id].astro).
- Topic and author archives: breadcrumbList.
- `faqPage` and `softwareApplication` exist in the constructors and are unused
  here. Leave them: a user who adds a pricing page should not have to write
  them.

## The plain-text surface

Three hand-written endpoints, all deriving URLs from `site`:

- src/pages/robots.txt.ts: allow all, disallow /search/ and /_emdash/ (the
  engine's back office), absolute sitemap.
- src/pages/llms.txt.ts: the site presented to agents; core pages plus the
  published posts.
- src/pages/[...locale]/rss.xml.ts: a per-language RSS 2.0 feed built by hand,
  drafts excluded, deterministic lastBuildDate (the newest post).

The sitemap integration filters out /404/, /examples/ and /search/
(astro.config.mjs), and the engine's on-demand sitemap
(src/moteur/plan-du-site.ts) keeps the same list. A page hidden from robots
should be hidden from the sitemap too; keep them in step. Its `serialize`
hook (astro.config.mjs) re-reads the `<link rel="alternate" hreflang>` tags
of the built page in dist/ and writes those, x-default included, as the
sitemap alternates; a page without them keeps the integration's own pairing. The head is the only
source, so the sitemap cannot contradict it.

## Images and indexing

- A share card is ONE PHOTOGRAPH AND NOTHING ELSE: no gradient, grid, eyebrow, title, wave, domain, panel
  or screenshot on it; the platform writes og:title under the preview.
  scripts/og.mjs crops a theme photo from src/assets into
  public/og/<slug>.jpg (1200x630, sharp "attention", JPEG 86) at every build,
  right after covers.mjs; public/og/ is not versioned. A new card is a line in
  its CARTES table, and pages pass it via the `image` prop; alt text is
  mandatory in that prop's shape.
- A post with a cover shares that cover cropped to a 1200x630 JPEG
  (`carteDuBillet` in `@moteur/source`): sharp at build time, or, engine on,
  the `/og/billet/<key>.jpg` route (docs/moteur.md). Never the cover file
  itself, which is a WebP of any size and shape. Without a cover, the post
  shares `/og/default.jpg`.
- `noindex` is a prop, not a habit (BaseHead.astro:84): draft posts and
  utility pages use it; everything else stays indexable.
